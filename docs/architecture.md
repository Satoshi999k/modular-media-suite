# Architecture Overview – Modular Media Streaming Suite

The **Modular Media Streaming Suite** is a flexible and extensible system designed to handle different media sources, runtime playback strategies, and modular feature plugins. The architecture is built around principles of modularity, reusability, and maintainability. Each major function is separated into layers and packages, allowing for easy updates or extensions without affecting the entire codebase.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 1. Overall Structure

The system is divided into several logical packages:

- **com.example.media.source** – defines and manages all media input types.
- **com.example.media.player** – controls playback and rendering operations.
- **com.example.media.plugin** – manages dynamic media enhancements or effects.
- **com.example.media.playlist** – handles playlists and nested playback structures.
- **com.example.media.proxy** – adds proxy and caching mechanisms for remote streams.

These modules communicate through shared interfaces and abstract classes, ensuring loose coupling and high flexibility.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 2. Core Components

### Media Source Layer
The **Media Source** layer is responsible for accessing different types of media. It uses the `MediaSource` interface as a contract that all source types must follow. This ensures that the player can interact with any source in a consistent manner.

Different implementations include:
- **LocalFileSource**, which simulates reading media from the local filesystem.
- **HlsStreamSource**, which represents a streaming source such as HLS.
- **RemoteApiSource**, which fetches content from an online API.
- **RemoteProxySource**, which acts as an intermediary that caches remote content.

This design promotes flexibility and scalability, since new types of media sources can be added by simply implementing the same interface.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Media Player Layer
The **MediaPlayer** class acts as the main controller of the system. It connects media sources, rendering strategies, and plugins. Its main responsibilities include loading media, playing it, applying plugins, and switching between renderers.  

This component coordinates all other layers. It doesn’t need to know the internal details of each source or plugin, only their shared interfaces, making it easy to maintain and extend.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Rendering Strategy Layer
The **Rendering Strategy** layer provides the capability to switch between different rendering methods at runtime. It applies the **Strategy Pattern**, which separates the rendering behavior into distinct strategy classes.

Two implementations are provided:
- **HardwareRenderer**, which simulates GPU-based playback.
- **SoftwareRenderer**, which simulates CPU-based rendering.

By separating these strategies, the player can dynamically choose which one to use without changing any core logic.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Plugin Layer (Feature Decorators)
The **Plugin** layer adds optional media enhancements through the **Decorator Pattern**. This allows the player to dynamically apply or remove effects such as subtitles, equalizers, or watermarks during playback.

Each plugin wraps around the media output process, adding extra behavior while preserving the core playback logic. For example:
- **SubtitlePlugin** adds captions on top of the video.
- **AudioEqualizerPlugin** adjusts sound frequencies.
- **WatermarkPlugin** overlays branding or text.

The decorator approach ensures that new features can be added without modifying the main player or renderer.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Playlist Layer
The **Playlist** layer is designed using the **Composite Pattern**, which allows both single media items and entire playlists to be treated uniformly.  

The **MediaItem** class represents a single playable file, while the **Playlist** class can contain multiple items or even other playlists. This makes it possible to create nested playback structures, such as a playlist containing sub-playlists.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Proxy Layer
The **Proxy** layer provides a mechanism for handling remote sources more efficiently. It uses the **Proxy Pattern** through the **RemoteProxySource** class, which manages caching and buffering. This helps improve performance and reliability when streaming from remote or unstable connections.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 3. Applied Design Patterns

The architecture makes use of several structural design patterns to improve organization and scalability.  

The **Strategy Pattern** is applied in the rendering system, allowing the player to easily switch between hardware and software renderers at runtime. This provides flexibility and adaptability to different hardware configurations.  

The **Decorator Pattern** is used in the plugin system, making it possible to dynamically attach or remove features such as subtitles or audio effects. This avoids modifying the player’s core code while extending its functionality.  

The **Composite Pattern** is applied in the playlist system, enabling both individual media files and grouped playlists to be handled in a uniform way. This makes nested or complex playlist structures easy to manage.  

The **Proxy Pattern** is used for remote streaming. It adds caching and buffering behavior to existing media sources without changing their implementation. This improves efficiency when dealing with network-based media.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 4. Flow of Operation

1. The user selects a media source (local file, stream, or remote).
2. The **MediaPlayer** initializes the chosen source and prepares a rendering strategy (hardware or software).
3. The player optionally applies one or more plugins, such as subtitles or watermarks.
4. The **Renderer** executes the playback, while the proxy layer may handle caching if the source is remote.
5. The **Playlist** system manages the order and grouping of media items during playback.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 5. Advantages of the Architecture

- **High Modularity:** Each feature exists in its own component, making maintenance simpler.
- **Easy Extensibility:** New renderers, plugins, or media types can be added without changing existing classes.
- **Reusable Components:** Interfaces and patterns encourage reuse across modules.
- **Scalable Design:** The modular approach supports future additions such as real streaming, graphical UI, or advanced caching.

## 6. Example Execution

When the system is executed, it simulates the process of loading and playing a media file. The terminal displays messages like:
